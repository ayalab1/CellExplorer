# Perform custom analysis directly from NeuroScope2
You can add your own custom functions that can be run from NeuroScope2 from the menu called Analysis. You must create a wrapper function for what you want to call outside NeuroScope2. There are a lot of examples included, that you can take inspiration from. The analysis tools are located in the `+analysis_tools`  folder. Please see the wrapper example at the bottom of this page.

## Organization of analysis tools and included functions 
The analysis menu and underlying `+analysis_tools` folder are organized according to the underlying data types of CellExplorer. Various functions are already included:

### behavior: 
- 2D and 
- 3D plot of behavior

### cell_metrics
- run ProcessCellMetrics 
- open CellExplorer
- Plot metrics for a subset of cells, including CCGs and other built-in plots from CellExplorer

### events
- detect ripples. Shows a dialog first, allowing for defining input parameters

### lfp
- generate the .lfp file from the raw data

### session
- Plot channel coordinates

### spikes
- Detect monosynaptic connections
- plot CCGs
- plot spike-rasters

### states
- Detect brain states using `SleepScoreMaster` - requires the Buzcode toolbox.
- Edit brain states in `TheStateEditor` - requires the Buzcode toolbox.

### timeseries
- open StateExplorer

### traces
- Plot correlation between channels
- Plot RMS noise across channels
- Show power spectral density across channels on a linear scale
- Show power spectral density across channels on a log scale
- Show temporal offsets between channels

The folder structure is purely for organization but the names are hard-coded in NeuroScope2, so they should not be altered. 

## Wrapper example provided

The wrapper example is located in the +traces folder ([`wrapper_example.m`](https://github.com/petersenpeter/CellExplorer/blob/master/%2Banalysis_tools/%2Btraces/wrapper_example.m)), use it to built your own analysis functions. 

```m
function out = wrapper_example(varargin)
% This is a wrapper example file for NeuroScope2. 
% Use this wrapper example to make calls from NeuroScope to any other analysis that can be applied to the traces, raw data or any derived data types.
% This function can be called from NeuroScope2 via the menu Analysis 

p = inputParser;

% The inputs are NeuroScope2 variables:
addParameter(p,'ephys',[],@isstruct); % UI: struct with UI elements and settings of NeuroScope2
addParameter(p,'UI',[],@isstruct); % ephys: Struct with ephys data for current shown time interval, e.g. ephys.raw (raw unprocessed data), ephys.traces (processed data)
addParameter(p,'data',[],@isstruct); % data: contains all external data loaded like data.session, data.spikes, data.events, data.states, data.behavior
parse(p,varargin{:})

ephys = p.Results.ephys;
UI = p.Results.UI;  
data = p.Results.data;

out = [];
