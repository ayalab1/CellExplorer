# Download and use our public data in CellExplorer
Any sessions located in the repository **NYUshare_Datasets** is publicly available and can be downloaded and loaded automatically in CellExplorer, without database credentials. Upon request the data will be downloaded from our [public web share](https://buzsakilab.nyumc.org/datasets/) and saved to the local CellExplorer directory `referenceData/` for future access. Be patient when downloading the data as some sessions are very large (up to hundreds of MB). Once downloaded you can project the reference data onto the current active session. This allows for direct comparison of your data with out public sessions spanning many brain regions, tasks and manipulations.
