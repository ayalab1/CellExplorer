# Graphical interfaces
{: .no_toc}
The main graphical interface is [CellExplorer](https://cellexplorer.org/interface/cellexplorer/), which allows you to explore your data on a single cell level. There are also two other important graphical interfaces: [gui_session](https://cellexplorer.org/interface/gui_session/) (for inspecting and entry of session-level metadata) and [NeuroScope2](https://cellexplorer.org/interface/neuroscope2/) (a data viewer for extracellular data). Finally, there is a graphical interface for curation of monosynaptic connections `gui_MonoSyn`, and an interface for curation of states from continues data `StateExplorer`.
